# Ally 
A final project at Lighthouse Labs

## In the modern era, our phone is a companion, but can we make sure that it’s a companion that we want to be with? 

Ally is a mood boosting app with a textless UI providing users with a nonintrusive space to let go of their thoughts with calming interactions and a relaxing, enjoyable sensory experience.

**as a user…
I want the app to feel like a breath of fresh air from social media.**

ALLY moves towards solving the issue of smartphone users reaching to their phones to increase their sense of personal wellbeing and ending up on social media. Designed as a compliment to social media when users crave a different quality of experience.

Ally prioritizes experience over information and uses a textless UI to provide a non-intrusive user experience where users can let go of their thoughts. 

-Features:
-Visual Rooms
-Sound Rooms

-Anonymous messages
